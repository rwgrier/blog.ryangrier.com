It's already March of 2023. Crazy huh? Time is flying by.

I'm keeping up my long habit of reading a lot of books. I am not a fast reader, but I tend to read every day. I also listen to books which helps.

I've already finished nine books in 2023. I thought I would give my thoughts on a few of those books below.

### _Fletch and the Widow Bradley_

I finished _[Fletch and the Widow Bradley](https://bookshop.org/a/92026/9781538541951)_ by Gregory McDonald in early January.

I started reading the Fletch books shortly after I heard them as a recommendation on MacBreak Weekly. On [episode 838](https://twit.tv/shows/macbreak-weekly/episodes/838?autostart=false), [Andy Ihnatko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ihnatko) recommended the Fletch series of books. He noted that they are included as part of an [Audible](https://www.audible.com) subscription. I've been listening to these books through Audible.

The first few books were really good. _Fletch and the Widow Bradley_ book wasn't as good as the first two.

These books are fast reads. I'm about halfway through the series (currently reading _Fletch's Moxie_). I've been reading these in between longer books.

### _Rules of Civility: A Novel_

Like I said in my [Some of my favorite things - 2022 Edition]({%post_url /2022/2022-12-30-some-of-my-favorite-things-2022-edition %}) post, Amor Towles was suggested to me by a soccer parent. She not only recommended _A Gentleman in Moscow_, but all of Amor Towles's books.

[_Rules of Civility: A Novel_](https://bookshop.org/a/92026/9780143121169) by Amor Towles is fantastic. I started reading this book late last year but didn't finish until early this year. It details how a chance encounter could change someone's life in an unexpected way.

This isn't an action-packed or high-suspense novel. However, there were evenings when I didn't want to put the book down. I really enjoyed it.

### _The Three-Body Problem_

I was recommended _[The Three-Body Problem](https://bookshop.org/a/92026/9780765382030)_ by Cixin Liu (translated by Ken Liu) a few years ago by a good friend of mine. At the time, I tried to get into it, but just couldn't. Oddly enough, this was around the same time I tried getting into _[The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series))_ series. I must have been in a weird state during that time.

I tried again earlier this year. This time I not only made it through the entire book, but I loved it.

_The Three-Body Problem_ is a fantastic Sci-fi novel. It takes place in China over a few decades. This is the first in a series of novels. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

### _The Lincoln Highway: A Novel_

I just finished [_The Lincoln Highway: A Novel_](https://bookshop.org/a/92026/9780735222359) by Amor Towles this past week. I've now read all of his novels.

The same soccer parent who recommended this book, also lent me this book to read. My wife and kids joke that I'm now part of a soccer book club.

This book is slightly different than the others from Amor Towles. Each chapter is from a different person's perspective. But it was also an excellent book.

Amor Towles has quickly become one of my favorite authors. I'm looking forward to more work from him.

### Wrapping up

These weren't all of the books that I've read so far in 2023. But these are the most memorable.

All of the books above are great reads if you're looking for any suggestions.
