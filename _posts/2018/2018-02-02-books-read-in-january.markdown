## I heard you like Star Wars

I’ve been on a Star Wars novel kick for almost a year now. I’m not sure why I’ve gone so deep into it, but I really like reading the content.

Recently, I’ve also started reading Star Wars comic books (mostly volumes/graphic novels). I haven’t read individual issues in a long time. I prefer reading the entire story arc in a single convenient location.

## How and why so many?

There are a lot of books on the list. When I grabbed a number of them (for my Kindle) for free, I hadn’t realized that they were more short stories rather than novels. Smuggler’s Run…, High Noon…, The Crimson Corsair…, and Before the Awakening were all more like short stories. I still read through them and enjoyed them.

## Why are you including comic books?

I dunno, why not. They aren’t individual issues, they are full length graphic novels. I don’t think I would include individual issues.

When I was growing up, I read tons of comic books. I used to spend days with my friends at the local comic book store. We would read them, trade them, talk about them. It was a big part of my childhood. So why not include them.

## What are you reading now?

I currently have three books going. A Kindle book, audiobook and comic. I’m taking a short break from Star Wars content (other than the comic), but I expect that I’ll get back to them soon enough. You’ll just have to wait until next month to find out.

## Most/Least favorites of the month?

My favorite book this month was Bloodline. It gave some nice insight on what happened in the Star Wars universe between the end of [Empire’s End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30213123-empire-s-end) (post Return of the Jedi) and The Force Awakens.

My least favorite book this month was Brave New World. There were parts of the book that I really enjoyed, but there were a lot that I didn’t. The concept (a dystopian future) was interesting, but it just wasn’t my style or taste. I can’t quite put my finger on what exactly I didn’t enjoy, but there was something.

I’m still at it. Reading every day. I’m hoping that I can reach at least one of my 2018 goals.
