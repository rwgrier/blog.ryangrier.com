So, this is it. I think it’s time that my blog has come to an end. This thing has been running for over 10 years. I don’t post as much as I used to. Besides, these things aren’t really even relevant anymore, are they? They are so 2004.

I’ll be deleting all of the old posts, but I have them archived away (for some reason).

If you want to know what I am up to, email me. You know the address. You don’t? Maybe I don’t want to talk to you anyway.
