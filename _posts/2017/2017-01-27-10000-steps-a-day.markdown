A few years ago, I had a [Fitbit Flex](https://www.fitbit.com/flex2). I got slightly obsessed with getting my 10k steps in everyday. I wasn’t always successful, but it was fun (and healthy) to try.

Now, I have a [Apple Watch Nike+](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-nike/) (Series 2). I had a series 0 Apple Watch when they first came out. I even wrote about my thoughts on that version of the watch here: [How I Use Apple Watch]( __GHOST_URL__ /how-i-use-apple-watch/), my thoughts on the watch have changed a bit since then, but that’s for another post.

Now I am not only trying to maintain that 10k steps/day, but I am also trying close the [rings](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204517) everyday. I’ve found that if I get 10,000 steps in a day, I’ll usually have completed all three rings (move, exercise and stand).

I usually go for a 1 mile walk twice a day. Usually in the morning and at lunchtime or after work. I also workout 4 - 6 times a week. A workout is usually a run, bike ride or strength training. I don’t have any issues closing the rings daily. Usually, as long as I get a walk or two in, I’ll be fine.

According to [Activity++](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/activity/id1089666978?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4), I’ve achieved my goals for at least 30 days.

At work we even have a “Step Challenge” going on. We’re seeing who (as an individual and teams) can get an average of the most steps each day in the month of January. There are really nice monetary rewards for being the first individual and on the first place team. As of today, I am in 10th place and on the third place team. My team spent most of the month in first place, but recently dropped to third.

Tracking steps and closing the rings is a fun way to try to stay healthy. I’m going to keep this going.
