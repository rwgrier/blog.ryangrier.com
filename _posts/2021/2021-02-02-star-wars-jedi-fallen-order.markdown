I recently finished playing through [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi:_Fallen_Order). What a good game.

I really enjoyed the game quite a bit. I bought the game when it first came out but kept getting distracted from it. This was my third attempt at the game. I finally finished it.

I played through the game on “Story Mode” which is the easiest difficulty. I used to play games on the hardest difficulty, but in the last few years, I just want to experience the story and not struggle with gameplay.

This game takes place a few years after &nbsp;[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_III_%E2%80%93_Revenge_of_the_Sith) . I won’t give away any spoilers here. But it was neat to explore a whole new storyline in the Star Wars universe. This game has a new set of (main) characters. Along with some villains that were introduced in [Star Wars Rebels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels)(an amazing TV show).

There’s this great Uncharted vibe to this game. You get to explore and solve puzzles in a variety of environments. I loved the Uncharted games, and this game feels similar. The story is also good, but I’m not sure if it’s because of the game’s story or because I really enjoy the Star Wars universe.

I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Star Wars and environmental puzzle games. But who am I kidding? If they are into those types of games, they’ve probably already played Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

I’m not entire sure what I’m going to play through next. I’ve dabbled in a few games, but nothing has really grabbed me yet.
