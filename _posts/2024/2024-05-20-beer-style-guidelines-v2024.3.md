I just released a major update to [Beer Style Guidelines](https://www.beerstyleguidelines.app) for [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beer-style-guidelines/id998139111). This is the largest macOS update since the initial Catalyst version in 2022. 

## What’s New?

Just like the iOS and iPadOS version that [I released in March]({%post_url /2024/2024-03-11-beer-style-guidelines-v2024.1 %}), the user interface has been completely rewritten. Previously, I used [Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/) to generate the macOS version of the app. The new version shares most of the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) codebase from the iOS and iPadOS versions.

I tried to stick with as much SwiftUI as I could for the macOS version. I was pretty successful in this effort. It helps that I don’t know much AppKit. This meant that the macOS version may be missing some features. 

## App Review

This was my first non-Catalyst app to go through Apple’s App Review. I had written a macOS app before, but I distributed it myself. 

App Review was much tougher on me for this release. They caught several issues I hadn’t thought of. I’m happy they checked the app for some basic things. We had several back and forth before they approved the app. 

## What’s Next?

I’m not sure yet. I’ll keep an eye out for any crash or bug reports. 

The 2024 version of the [Brewers Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org) [Style Guide](https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/) hasn’t been released yet. 

While I wait, I’m debating between several projects. 

One possible project is something completely new. I have a feeling it will take me a long time to implement. I’m not sure if I’m ready for that kind of commitment yet. But this may be an app that can make some extra income for me. 

I have two other ideas for Beer Style Guidelines. I’m not going to give away the ideas yet. But these could be fun to work on.
