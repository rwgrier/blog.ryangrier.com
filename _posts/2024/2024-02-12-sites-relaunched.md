It’s been a while since I’ve posted anything here. I’m sorry. I’ve neglected the site and blog. 

Recently, I decided that I should rework the site and blog. I totally called this in my [Moved From Jekyll to Ghost]({%post_url /2022/2022-08-17-moved-to-ghost %}) post in 2022. I seem to get the urge to change everything with the site every few years. This is one of those times. 

My last big blog move was from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to [Ghost](https://ghost.org). This time, I’m going the other way. I’m moving back to Jekyll from Ghost. 

## Why?

I like the Ghost platform. I was paying for hosting from [DigitalPress](https://www.digitalpress.blog). They are a great hosting company. The thing is, I just wasn’t using the service enough to justify the monthly cost. It wasn’t expensive, but it does cost _something_.   

I can host the blog and site for free from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The sites are deployed from [GitHub](https://github.com), where I host the code for both sites. 

I keep saying sites. Technically, there are two sites. There’s the blog and the rest of it. When I started this latest rework, I wasn’t going to include the blog at all. So I made the rest of the site without the blog. Then I thought I should include the blog again, just in case I wanted to start ~~writing~~ blogging more. 

The site ([www.ryangrier.com](https://www.ryangrier.com)) is a static html site. I used HTML and Bootstrap to create the site. The [code is available](https://github.com/rwgrier/rwgrier.github.io) on GitHub. The site is hosted on Netlify. I created this first. I had it launched for a week or two before deciding to re-add the blog. 

The blog ([blog.ryangrier.com](https://blog.ryangrier.com)) uses Jekyll to generate the site. I created my own “theme” here that roughly matches the rest of the site. This code for the [blog is also available](https://github.com/rwgrier/blog.ryangrier.com) on GitHub.

I have my old RSS URLs redirect to the new RSS URL. I did not however redirect all of the old posts. That was going to be a lot of work that I’m not really interested in doing. The blog is mostly for me anyway. I don’t think anyone is reading it. 

## Where’d the older posts go? 

I originally imported all of the posts from Ghost. As I was cleaning up some of the old posts, I realized they were outdated. A lot of the non-technical ones didn’t need to be here anymore. So as this post was published, I removed those older posts. 

I’ll likely hold onto a lot of the personal posts for about a year and then remove them. I plan on keeping the technical posts around for longer (or forever), I haven’t really decided yet. 

If you really want to get to those older posts, you can find them (with some work) in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rwgrier/blog.ryangrier.com). 

## So, what’s next? 

What's next? I dunno. This may be it. Or I may decide to start ~~writing~~ blogging again.
