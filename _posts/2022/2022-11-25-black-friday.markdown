It's Black Friday.

When I was younger, I don't think I really knew what Black Friday was. When I met my wife, I learned all about Black Friday. She used to go out from morning until night with her family shopping. I never went with them, that was too much shopping for me.

I've done some Black Friday shopping from time to time. But I am definitely not an all-day shopper. I prefer online shopping. &nbsp;

In the last few years, the stores haven't been having the best deals anyway. Maybe I'm just pickier about the stuff I want or get. Somehow I manage to find _something_ to get each year.

My favorite part of today is having off from work. ðŸ˜€
