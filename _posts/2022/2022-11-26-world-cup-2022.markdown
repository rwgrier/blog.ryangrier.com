The World Cup is happening right now. It started last Sunday (Nov, 20th). It runs through December 18th.

Qatar is the host country this year. There's been [plenty of controversy](https://nypost.com/2022/11/15/all-the-controversies-surrounding-the-qatar-world-cup-in-2022/) around their handling of the games. If you can try to block all of that out, it's an exciting time.

We're currently in the group stage of the games.

The [US Men's National Team](https://www.ussoccer.com/teams/usmnt) is back in the World Cup (after [failing to qualify](https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2017/10/11/16457352/usa-mens-soccer-2018-world-cup-usmnt-qualifying-results) for the 2018 World Cup). They've played two games so far. The US team has two ties (draws) and is in third place in [Group B](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/world-cup-2022-group-b-draw-teams-schedule-fixtures-times/acptybvjxmt2t8vvxqaiojan). I believe that the US will need to win on Tuesday in order to move on, but I could be wrong.

This World Cup is also interesting because it's supposed to be [Lionel Messi's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi) last World Cup for [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team). NPR has a great podcast mini-series ([The Last Cup](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510367/the-last-cup)) about Messi and his experience with the Argentina national team. &nbsp;

I have no idea how well the US will do. They haven't historically been great at this. But I've got high hopes. We got this. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
