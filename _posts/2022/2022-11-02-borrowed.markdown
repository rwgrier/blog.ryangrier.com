I borrowed an [ebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebook) from my local library for the first time yesterday. I've borrowed books from the library, but never an ebook. I wasn't sure how it would work.

I borrowed [Stephen King](https://stephenking.com)'s [Billy Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Summers). I've read a lot of Stephen King over the years, but never this book. I'm looking forward to it.

I've been a fan of [E-readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-reader) for years. I got my first [Amazon Kindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle) in 2010 and haven't looked back. E-readers are incredibly convenient. My kindle holds hundreds of books. Being able to borrow an ebook sounds great. &nbsp;

The process to borrow the book was incredibly easy. I installed the [OverDrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) app. Then I connected my library card, found a book, borrowed it, then connected my Amazon account. The book was delivered to my Kindle. Easy peasy.

Well. It wasn't effortless. The first four or five books I looked at have 10+ week waits. One book I tried to borrow has a 26-week wait. Yikes. I requested holds on several books. But once I found a book that was available, it was easy.

I've got two weeks to read Billy Summer's. I'm a slow reader, so I hope I can finish in time. I think I can renew the book loan, but that remains to be seen.

I'm excited to dive into this book.
