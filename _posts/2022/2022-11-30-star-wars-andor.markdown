I finished watching [Star Wars: Andor](https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/andor) yesterday. That is a good show.

Andor portrays the events of [Cassian Andor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassian_Andor) that lead up to [Rogue One: A Star Wars Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One). I wasn't sure if I would like a story about Cassian, but I did. If you want more lead-up content to Rogue One, read [Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst:_A_Rogue_One_Novel).

Andor didn't have any [space magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force) or [laser swords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber). It didn't need it. The story was solid. There were [some](https://cosmicbook.news/andor-review-slow-boring-not-star-wars) [arguments](https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/andor-s-slow-approach-to-star-wars-references-explained-by-diego-luna/ar-AA12onlx) that the show was slow, but I don't think it was.

If you watch this series, make sure you stick around for the post-credit scene in the finale. It's probably not integral to the story, but it adds a bit extra.

I know there will be a [second season](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/andor-season-2), and I'm looking forward to it. Now I need to watch [Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/wp/7ZQbZDR64MvB).
