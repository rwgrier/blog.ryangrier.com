I finished Metroid: Samus Returns on Wednesday night (during the Phillies game).

Metroid: Samus Returns is a game for the Nintendo [2DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_2DS)/[3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS). It was released in 2017. Samus Returns is a remake of the 1991 game [Metroid II: Return of Samus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_II:_Return_of_Samus).

I've had this game since launch, but never completed it. I started it a few times, but always got distracted and never finished it.

When I finished [Ori and the Will of the Wisps]({%post_url /2022/2022-10-10-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps %}), I got the itch to play a proper Metroid game. I decided to start Metroid: Samus Returns over with the intention of completing it. I finished it Wednesday.

I took my time and worked through the game. I didn't get 100% of the collectibles. I also didn't try to speed-run the game. I finished the game at 86.7% in 16:20:35 (after beating the final boss).

Forgive my photo above. I don't even know if you can take a screenshot on the 3DS. I also took this photo before fighting the final boss, so it doesn't include my final stats.

This game was great. There was plenty of exploration. It wasn't too hard. The only trouble I really had was against the [Diggernaut](https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Diggernaut). I died a lot against that boss. I'm still bad at video games, so I enjoy games that aren't too difficult.

I've played two [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania) games right in a row. I thought about trying out [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com), but I've heard it's brutal and I'm not ready for that. I think I am ready to play a different type of game next. I'm just not sure what game I should play. Knowing me, it'll be from a few years ago. I never seem to play brand-new games.

If you like Metroid games and have a 2DS/3DS, check out Metroid: Samus Returns.
