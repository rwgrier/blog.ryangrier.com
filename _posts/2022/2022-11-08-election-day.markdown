Today is election day in the US. Have you voted? You should.

My company has off today. That gave me a chance to make sure I got to my polling station and voted. I went shortly after lunch and the lines weren't too bad.

During the 2020 election, I voted via mail. This time I voted in person. I didn't have off in 2020 and wasn't sure how long the lines would be. I wanted to make sure I got my vote in and didn't get discouraged in line. Plus COVID.

My daughter voted for her first time today. She was very excited and nervous.

Sadly, one of the best parts about election day being here is that the political ads stop. This also means I'll stop getting political calls and text messages.

Please get out and vote if you haven't already.
