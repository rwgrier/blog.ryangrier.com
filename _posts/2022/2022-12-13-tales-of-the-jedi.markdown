I finished watching [_Tales of the Jedi_](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/star-wars-tales-of-the-jedi/7ZQbZDR64MvB) on [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com). It's a series of animated shorts from the Star Wars prequel era. The series provides more detail about both [Ahsoka Tano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano) and [Count Dooku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dooku).

I really liked this series. I breezed through it quickly.

I loved _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ (and _Star Wars Rebels_). _Tales of the Jedi_ fit right in.

I've actually started watching _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ again because I liked it so much.

Ahsoka Tano may be my favorite Star Wars character. She was a little silly in the beginning. Through the various TV shows and even in the book ([_Star Wars: Ahsoka_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Ahsoka)_),_ she really grew into her character. I'm looking forward to the live-action show [_Ahsoka_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)) coming out next year.

If you liked _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ and _Star Wars Rebels_ check out this series. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Even if you are, the shows are incredibly short.
