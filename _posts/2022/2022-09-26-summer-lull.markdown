I have been in a lull lately.

Last month, I [shipped]({%post_url /2022/2022-08-22-beer-style-guidelines-2022-4-2 %}) the last major version of Beer Style Guidelines. Now I'm taking a break before diving into a new side project.

This should be a much needed break. It usually would be. But we're in the midst of high school soccer season. That means 2-3 games a week with practice every weekday. It's been very busy for us, and even more so for the players.

I have been doing other things here and there. But not much.

I'll be getting back to a side project soon. I have a few ideas in mind. None of the ideas have grabbed my attention yet.

Until I decide on what I want to do, Iâ€™ll enjoy not doing much.
