We started watching [Breaking Bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad) last week. We finished season 2, episode 3 last night.

I know a lot of people love this show. I don't. I wanted to like it, but I don't. I powered through the first season because I heard it was a little slow. But so far, season 2 isn't any better.

I don't think any of the characters are likable. The only one who is remotely nice is [Dean Norris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Norris) as [Hank Schrader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Schrader). I find it easier to enjoy shows when there are characters in the show that I like. Breaking Bad just doesn't have any of those characters. &nbsp;

I've heard the show continues to get darker and [Walter White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_(Breaking_Bad)) does some crazy stuff. I don't think I want to stick around to see what happens.

There are so many other good shows out there. I'm not sure I'm going to waste any more time on Breaking Bad.
