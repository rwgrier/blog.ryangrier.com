I’m a fairly recent [PlayStation 5](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/) (PS5) owner (last Christmas). [Astro’s Playroom](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astros-playroom/) is almost the perfect game. It’s free, easy, and short. It’s also delightful.

I played though this game over a few days and loved it. I got all of the puzzle pieces and artifacts. I didn’t get all of the trophies and don’t plan to.

This game comes with all PS5 consoles. If you can get a PS5, try this game out.

That is all.
