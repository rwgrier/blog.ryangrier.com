On Sunday night, we finished watching [Mare of Eastown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_of_Easttown) on [HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com). It was a good show.

We've been watching it for a few weeks. The postseason Phillies run sidelined our regular television watching.

We liked the twists and turns that happened throughout the season. I also like the [Wawa](https://www.wawa.com) references (I mean, who doesn't?).

The only thing in the show that really threw me for a loop was some of the accents. When I heard certain words, it immediately took me out of the story. "Home" was a harsh word/accent to hear during the show. I don't know if those accents are accurate to the area. Those accents even became part of an [SNL](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/episodes) skit: &nbsp;

I was able to see past the accents and enjoy the show. I've heard that there may be a second season.

If you haven't seen Mare of Easttown and enjoy a good murder mystery, check it out. &nbsp;
