We just got home from the [PDA Boys Invitational Showcase](https://pdasoccer.demosphere-secure.com/tournaments/pda-boys-college-showcase). It's a soccer showcase where college scouts/coaches can take a look at prospective players. This showcase took place in Zarephath, New Jersey.

We did very well. We won two games and lost one. The wins and losses aren't the point of a showcase. The point of showcases is so that college scouts and coaches can watch the kids play.

Over 20 college scouts/coaches came out to watch our games. They probably weren't just there for our team, but I like to think they were.

This showcase was a bit of a hike from home, and our first game today was early, so we stayed overnight.

We did this same showcase last year. Last year was pretty miserable. It was cold, rainy, and windy. Last year, we didn't stay overnight, so we did a lot of driving.

This year, even though we stayed there, it was still a long weekend. &nbsp;

Saturday's weather was perfect. It was sunny and a great temperature for playing soccer. I thought it was going to be colder, so I over-dressed.

Today's weather was pretty miserable. It was chilly and pouring. The kids were all soaked through. The (grass) field was getting ripped up. The kids also slid all over the place. I'm just happy that no one got hurt. I thought they should have stopped the game once the field got ripped up.

It was a good weekend, but I'm glad to be home now.
