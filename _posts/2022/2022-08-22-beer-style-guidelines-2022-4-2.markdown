[Beer Style Guidelines](https://www.beerstyleguidelines.app/) 2022.5 has been released.

This update includes:

- An updated sidebar (guide list)
- Fixed a crashing issue when putting the app into the background
- Fixed a crashing issue that occurred sometimes when rotating the device.
- Added macOS support via Mac Catalyst.

The key feature for this release is [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) support via [Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/).

I [had previously]({%post_url /2022/2022-07-26-the-future-of-beer-style-guidelines %}) mentioned that I planned on adding Mac Catalyst support to Beer Style Guidelines. I did it. It's not perfect, but it runs pretty well on macOS.

This is also the final large-scale update I plan on making to Beer Style Guidelines for a while. If there are crashing (or other major) issues I'll fix them.

I haven't decided yet if I'll include new style guides as they come out. New style guides usually don't come out until the Spring, so I have some time.

Beer Style Guidelines has had a good run. But I am very excited to work on something new.
