Can you believe the [Philadelphia Phillies](https://www.mlb.com/phillies) made it to the [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series)? Me either. I love that they made it. I've [said before]( __GHOST_URL__ /phillies/) that every postseason game was free baseball and I still believe that.

[Houston](https://www.mlb.com/astros) deserves some props. They were undefeated in the playoffs until meeting the Phillies. Then, in the World Series, they didn't lose after game 3. I really think they had more depth than we had and just outlasted us. I still think the Astros have the [cheating scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal) looming over them. I still think of them as cheaters.

Even though the Phillies didn't win, I am so proud of how they played and got there.

At least we won two games against the Astros. Game 3 was absolutely incredible and a ball to watch. The games after that? Not so much.

The amount of Phillies pride I saw in our area in October and November was incredible. Yesterday, we went shopping at the [Philadelphia Premium Outlets](https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/philadelphia) and there was Phillies gear everywhere.

Each and every postseason game was a blessing. We weren't supposed to be there. We weren't supposed to beat the Cardinals. We weren't supposed to beat the Braves. We weren't supposed to beat the Padres. We beat them all.

Really. I still can't believe the Phillies made the World Series. &nbsp;

So... Maybe this success sets us up for next year. I certainly hope so.
