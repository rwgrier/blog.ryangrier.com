In 2022, I've consumed a lot of media. It was mostly books and tv shows.

This post is to pick out a few of my favorites. I did this type of post [last year]({%post_url /2021/2021-12-31-some-of-my-favorite-things-2021-edition %}) too.

## Books

I've read a lot of books in 2022. As of this posting, I've completed 45 books in 2022 alone. It's really hard to pick a favorite. I've read a lot of good books. I've also read a few stinkers. But I think I've got it narrowed down to a favorite and runner up.

### Favorite

My favorite book this year was [_Leviathan Falls_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_Falls) by [James S.A. Corey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_S._A._Corey). Leviathan Falls was the final book in [The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)) series. I've [written]({%post_url /2022/2022-04-09-on-finishng-the-expanse %}) about the series before. I really enjoyed how this book wrapped up the series.

The Expanse series was a slow burn (for me), but well worth the trip.

This entire series was written by James S.A. Corey, but that's actually two people. James S.A. Corey is a pen name for [Daniel Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Abraham_(author)) and [Ty Franck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Franck). Daniel released a new book called _[Age of Ash](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58340712)_ earlier this year, and I'm currently reading that now.

### Runner up

_[A Gentleman in Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Gentleman_in_Moscow)_ by [Amor Towles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_Towles) was an unexpected delight for me.

The book was recommended to me by a soccer parent. We were on the sideline during the game and chatting about books. She recommended _A Gentleman in Moscow_ to me. I didn't think much about it until a few days later when I saw someone (online) recommend _A Gentleman in Moscow_ and Towles's other books. A few days after that, I saw _another_ recommendation for _A Gentleman in Moscow_.

I decided that I had to read the book. I was not disappointed. It was excellent. There wasn't a lot of action or drama. But the relationships built in the book were fascinating.

I've started reading another book by Amor Towles called _[Rules of Civility](https://www.amortowles.com/rules-of-civility-about-the-book/)_.

## Movies

I didn't watch a lot of movies in 2022. Most of the ones I did watch were not memorable. This category was tough. My favorite was a 2021 movie (that I watched in 2022) and my runner up was a movie I watched last week.

### Favorite

_[The Matrix Resurrections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Resurrections)_ was released in 2021, but I watched it in early 2022. I [wrote]({%post_url /2022/2022-01-14-the-matrix-movies %}) about this movie and the other Matrix movies earlier this year.

This movie wasn't as good as the original Matrix movie. The original is one of my favorites.

I really should watch this again.

### Runner up

Last week, I watched _[Thor: Love and Thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor:_Love_and_Thunder)_. It was great. The first two Thor movies weren't the best. But this movie and _Thor: Ragnarok_ were really good.

I think that [Taika Waititi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taika_Waititi) (as [Korg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korg_(character))) made an excellent addition to the team. Taika also directed the last two Thor movies. I think his direction may have made these movies better too. But I can't be sure.

This has been the best [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) (MCU) movie since _[Avengers: Endgame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Endgame)_ and _[Spider-Man: Far From Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Far_From_Home)_. The Disney+ TV shows have been good, but I haven't loved the movies. I have been a fan of the _[Infinity Gauntlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinity_Gauntlet)_ and _[Infinity War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinity_War)_ comics since I was younger.

## TV Shows

We watched a lot of TV shows in 2022. I've got an entire list of shows that I really liked. My favorites came down to _Severance_, _Andor_ and [_Welcome to Wrexham_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Wrexham). But I had to narrow it down to a favorite and a runner up. So here we are.

### Favorite

My favorite show of the year is _[Severance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series))_ on [Apple TV+](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/).

At first, I wasn't sure what was happening in the show. But the show really grew on me and by the time the season was over, I wanted more.

This scene above is from my favorite scene of the entire season. It's one of my favorite scenes from any TV show. Every time I see it, I smile a little and do a little dance in my seat.

The show ended on such a great cliffhanger too. I cannot wait for the next season.

### Runner up

My runner up is a Star Wars show. Of course it was. ðŸ™‚ But [_Andor_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)) really was a good show.

_Andor_ was a very close runner up. I [wrote]({%post_url /2022/2022-11-30-star-wars-andor %}) about _Andor_ earlier this year. I'm not going to say too much about it here. But I loved this show.

## Video Games

I didn't play a lot of games this year. I think I played more games this year than in the last few years. There were three new (to me) games that I played this year that I really loved. Those games were _Ori and the Will of the Wisps_, _[Metroid: Samus Returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid%3A_Samus_Returns)_, and _Stray_. Just like the TV shows, I narrowed it down to a favorite and a runner up, but it was _really_ close.

### Favorite

My favorite game of 2022 is _[Ori and the Will of the Wisps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ori_and_the_Will_of_the_Wisps)_. The game is from 2020, but I _finally_ played it this year. I also [wrote]({%post_url /2022/2022-10-10-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps %}) about _Ori and the Will of the Wisps_ earlier this year.

I played this game prior to the first game in the series [_Ori and the Blind Forrest_](https://www.orithegame.com/blind-forest/). I recently bought the first game (on sale) and will probably be playing through sometime soon. ðŸ¤ž

### Runner up

This was a hard choice. I ended up going with _[Stray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_(video_game))_, simply because it was from this year. _Stray_ is also the freshest game in my mind. I [finished it]({%post_url /2022/2022-12-22-stray %}) last week. It was a really beautiful game.

## 2023

2023 is approaching quickly. I can't believe it, but its almost here.

I've got a list of Books, TV shows, and video games that I plan on consuming. I hope to watch a few more movies. But only time will tell.
