I've been on vacation this week. We haven't gone anywhere, it's more of a [staycation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staycation). I've been doing a bunch of chores around the house that have been on hold because of soccer and other obligations. I've also gotten a bit of time to relax and enjoy some things that I want to.

Today, I finished [Stray](https://stray.game) on the [Playstation 5](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/). I [was interested](/2022/11/24/currently-playing/) in playing Stray, but a [comment](https://mastodon.social/@Llokalla/109396143069427790) from [José Ibañez](https://mastodon.social/@Llokalla) got me to give it a shot.

Stray is a game where you play as a cat in a post-apocalyptic world who has been separated from their family (fellow cats). You are just trying to get back to your family. Along the way, you meet a lot of robots, explore some great environments and solve many puzzles.

I'm so glad José suggested I play Stay. What a great game. The game was beautiful, incredibly charming, short, and not too difficult. I finished the game in about six hours. I wasn't anywhere close to completing at 100%. But I enjoyed the game immensely.

I don't really like cats, and never thought I would enjoy playing a game as a cat. But I did. The way the cat moved and jumped looked perfect. The game itself was really beautiful. There were some really nice puzzles that weren't too hard. I'm hated the [Zurks](https://stray.fandom.com/wiki/Zurks), but loved [B-12](https://stray.fandom.com/wiki/B-12). Overall, Stray was a great game.

I've thought about going back and trying to get all of the [Playstation Trophies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network#Trophies) in the game, but I'm not sure I want to do that. I've got too many other games I want to play. Getting frustrated trying to get all of the trophies in this game isn't worth it to me. &nbsp;

The game is from 2022 which is weird for me. I usually end up playing games a year or two after they've been released. It was fun to play (and finish) a new game.

Stray is available "free" on Playstation via [Playstation Plus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/) Extra. I am a subscriber, so I took advantage of this. If you're a Playstation Plus Extra subscriber and haven't played Stray yet, go do so.
