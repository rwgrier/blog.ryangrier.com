I'm not currently playing any video games.

I just finished [Assemble with Care](https://www.assemblegame.com) by [ustwo Games](https://www.ustwogames.co.uk). They made the Monument Valley games I [previously wrote about](/2022/10/17/revisiting-monument-valley-1-2/). Assemble with Care was a fun little game. Each level (or story section) was small enough to complete in a single sitting. It also had a nice story.

I'm not 100% sure what I should play next. I have a ton of games on my list. But here are my most attractive options (right now).

- [Forza Horizon 5](https://forza.net/horizon/)
- [Assassin's Creed Valhalla](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/valhalla)
- [Destiny 2](https://www.destinythegame.com/) (the [latest season](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfPlunder))
- [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/play/horizon) (yeah, the first one)
- [Stray](https://stray.game/)
- [Final Fantasy VII Remake](https://ffvii-remake.square-enix-games.com/)
- [Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart](https://insomniac.games/game/ratchet-clank-rift-apart)
- [Nobody Saves the World](https://www.nobodysavestheworld.com)
- [Yoshi's Crafted World™](https://yoshiscraftedworld.nintendo.com/)
- [Super Mario™ 3D World + Bowser's Fury](https://supermario3dworld.nintendo.com/)
- [Paper Mario™: The Origami King](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/paper-mario-the-origami-king-switch/)
- [Ori and the Blind Forrest](https://www.orithegame.com/blind-forest/)
- [Hob](https://runicgames.com/)
- [LEGO Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga](https://www.starwars.com/games-apps/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga) 

There are a lot of games here. Probably too many.

I haven't finished any of these games above. I've started a few, but probably not enough to be able to pick back up. I would likely need to start any of them over again.

I'll probably decide soon enough. But for now, I'm not sure what to play.
