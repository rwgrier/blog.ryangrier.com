I did it. I published a blog post every day in November. Go me.

My [November Experiment]( __GHOST_URL__ /november-experiment/) was a success. It started out easy enough, but as the month went on, I had trouble coming up with ideas. This last few days was the toughest.

I had a few posts in mind with specific days ([Thanksgiving]( __GHOST_URL__ /thanksgiving/), [Black Friday]( __GHOST_URL__ /black-friday/), this one). I also tried to plan out posts a few days in advance so I wouldn't have to do it last minute. But a few of the posts were written in a hurry.

I don't think daily is the correct cadence for posting here. I don't feel like I get the right about of time to mull over what I had written before posting it. I may try once or twice a week for a bit.

I'm glad my experiment was successful. I'm even more glad that it's over.
