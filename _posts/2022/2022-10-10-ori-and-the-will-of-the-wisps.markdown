Last week, I finished the game [Ori and the Will of the Wisps](https://www.orithegame.com). I played through it on the Nintendo Switch. I bought the game a while ago when it was on sale and haven't played it until recently.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the sequel to [Ori and the Blind Forrest](https://www.orithegame.com/blind-forest/). I never played the first game, but I have heard good things about it.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania) game. It means I got to explore, backtrack, and collect a lot of upgrades. I really like this type of game, I'm not sure why I don't play more of them.

This game was absolutely delightful. The graphics and soundtrack were amazing. The platforming was spot on. The game wasn't too tricky, and intriguing enough to keep my interest.

I played through the game on easy (I'm bad at video games). I finished the game with 75% completion in just over 15 hours. I did not get 100% of the items. I've thought about going back through and collecting everything else, but I probably won't. I just have too many games to play. &nbsp;

I know this game was released in 2020, but it's my favorite game of 2022 so far.

I want to play through Ori and the Blind Forrest now, but I've heard that Ori and the Will of the Wisps was better and I don't want to be disappointed. But if the original game goes on sale, I'll probably get it.

The [digital version](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-switch/) of Ori and the Will of the Wisps is selling for $10.19 (USD) through October 16th, 2022. It's worth every penny. If you like Metroidvania games and haven't played this game, give it a shot.
