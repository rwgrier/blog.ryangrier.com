I read comic books. I have since I was younger. Heck, I even developed a comic book reader for iOS and tvOS for [DC Universe](https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com) (now DC UNIVERSE INFINITE). It was essentially peak nerd for me.

I used to really like [Comixology](https://comixology.com). I've purchased and read a lot of comic books through them. Comixology was purchased by [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com) in 2014. &nbsp;

Earlier this year, the original Comixology site was shut down in favor of an Amazon variant of the site. It's not a great site. When I search for something, I always end up searching all of Amazon. On the product details screen, the tiers to purchase things are confusing. There's a purchase price. Some books are available through [Kindle Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/bookshelf?ref_=sv_kstore_3&ie=UTF8), some are available through [Comixology Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/cu/signup?pageCode=cuStandard). Other books are included with [Prime Reading](https://us.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/prime-pr/?_encoding=UTF8&ref_=sv_kstore_4). It's all a bit much.

I don't think I've purchased any new comics since the changeover. I'm not quite sure if this is because of the changeover or because I've been reading fewer comics now that I no longer work on DC Universe.

Of course, I'm not sure why I'm complaining. The Kindle store has been like this for years and I've just worked around it.
