[iOS 16](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-16/) introduced a reimagined Lock Screen. You can now do some really lovely [personalization](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/personalize-your-iphone-lock-screen-iph4d0e6c351/ios).

I have a few widgets including weather, battery levels, and my Activity Rings.

For the wallpaper, I have Photo Shuffle turned on and love it. I'll get a new photo set on my lock screen (and wallpaper) every hour.

My shuffle categories are set to People (my family members), Pets, Nature, and Cities.

It's entertaining to see old photos of the kids or dogs. I really love seeing photos that I haven't seen in years. Sometimes I'll also get some nice-looking photos I've taken on hikes or while traveling.

I included a few samples above.

I do wish there was a way to get to that photo directly from the lock screen. I've come across a few that I don't know where they came from. I'd love to tap into the photo itself and see the original.

I would also like to be able to add more widgets to the lock screen. But that's a minor complaint.

I really do love the Photo Shuffle feature on the lock screens. It's a great addition to iOS 16.
