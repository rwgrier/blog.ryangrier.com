I listen to the [MacBreak Weekly](https://twit.tv/shows/macbreak-weekly) podcast. [About a month ago](https://twit.tv/shows/macbreak-weekly/episodes/838?autostart=false), [Andy Ihnatko](https://twitter.com/ihnatko)'s pick of the week was the ["Fletch" book series](https://www.audible.com/series/The-Fletch-Audiobooks/B07CMMQ46L).

The series is currently free. I believe it's free for any [Audible](https://www.audible.com) Plus members (like me). At least I would assume you would need to be a member to listen to the series for free.

There are 11 books in total. The first one was published in 1974 and the final one was published in 1994. &nbsp;

I've been listening to the novels. They are pretty good. They are also short books and you can get through them pretty quickly. I just finished book 3 ([Fletch's Fortune](https://www.audible.com/pd/Fletchs-Fortune-Audiobook/B07FXLVBS8?qid=1668129977&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=CXQVV4J1J70TPB81KFM4)). I really liked the first book. The second two books have fallen off a bit for me. &nbsp;

In my mind, I picture [Chevy Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevy_Chase) as Fletch, just like the [Fletch movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletch_(film)). There's a [new movie out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confess,_Fletch) with [Jon Hamm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm) as Fletch. I haven't seen that one yet.

If you're an Audible Plus subscriber and looking for some good books, check these out.
