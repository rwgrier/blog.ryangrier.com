Yesterday the [Philadelphia Union](https://www.philadelphiaunion.com) played [Los Angeles Football Club](https://www.lafc.com) in the [MLS](https://www.mlssoccer.com) Cup Final. It was a great game. Ultimately the Union lost in penalty kicks after a 3-3 draw.

The results were disappointing. But it was nice that the two best MLS teams made it to the finals. It's a shame that LAFC ended up winning.

Congrats to LAFC.

This was the Union's first trip to the finals. They almost made it last year, but lost in the conference finals. We were at that game. The starters couldn't play in that game because they all had COVID. So it was really nice to see them make it to the finals this year.

I think the Union has a really strong team. I believe we may be losing a few guys next year. I hope that we can continue to be a strong team.

There's always next year. &nbsp;
