[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet](https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/) are released tomorrow. I don't think I'm going to be getting this one. Yet.

Since [2015]({%post_url /2015/2015-09-21-pokemon %}), I've played a handful of Pokémon games, mainly on the [Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS). I've also [played]({%post_url /2020/2020-09-09-pokemon-sword %}) [Pokémon Sword](https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/) on the [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/). I really liked these games. Particularly the games on the DS/3DS. They just felt special to me.

Most recently, I've played [Pokémon Legends: Arceus](https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/). I didn't really like it. It was interesting, but I couldn't get into it. Maybe it strayed too far from the normal Pokémon formula. I may try this game again at some point, but right now it's sitting on a shelf.

Some of the reviews ([NintendoLife](https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet), [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23462736/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-release-date-nintendo-switch), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch)) for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet make it sound like the game needs a little work. There are some positive reviews too, but those reviews also call out some technical issues with the game.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet seem more in line with the Pokémon games that I'm used to. Maybe I'll eventually pick it up. But for now, I'm happy to wait and see how the game is updated.
